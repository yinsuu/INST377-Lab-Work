    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to somethings</em> in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.</p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.<br/><hr/>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

    <img src = 'images/mochi.jpg' alt = 'A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.gif' alt = 'A dancing mochi ball'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.svg' alt = 'A mochi ball with Bezier handles'/>
    <img src = 'images/mochi.png' alt = 'A mochi ball'/><hr/>
